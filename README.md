# StitchLabs_PHP

This is a simple PHP SDK for interacting with the http://StitchLabs.com JSON API.

It currently handles creation and reading to/from most entities.

The actual structure of these entities would need to be handled by code implementing this SDK. (Such as the Contact -> Person -> PersonField relationship.)
